Our project is called "Natural Disaster Tracker".

Initially , the goal of our project was to be able to track earthquakes around the world, and
particularly BC since we go to school there. Later we decided to include more natural disasters such as floods, droughts,
volcanic activities and more.

We created a webpage that has a complete list of these catastrophes, from there you can filter out events by the type of catastrophe, the coordinates, a radius around the coordinates as well as a time frame filter. All in all with this you can find a list of natural disasters that happened with a very specific criterion!

A large part of our project depended on using the data provided by the NASA EONET API. The EONET(Earth Observatory Natural Event Tracker) API 
provided us with all the different kinds of natural disasters organized by cateogries and further contained data on specific events
that have occured since the time it started tracking. 

We used Python and Flask for the API interactions and fetching the data and then represented the data using our HTML&CSS files.
