Our project is called "Natural Disaster Tracker".

Initially , the goal of our project was to be able to track earthquakes around the world, and
particularly BC since we go to school there. Later we decided to include more natural disasters such as floods, droughts,
volcanic activities and more.

A large part of our project depended on using the data provided by the NASA EONET API. The EONET(Earth Observatory Natural Event Tracker) API 
provided us with all the different kinds of natural disasters organized by cateogries and further contained data on specific events
that have occured since the time it started tracking. 

We used Python and Flask for the API interactions and fetching the data and then represented the data using our HTML&CSS files.
